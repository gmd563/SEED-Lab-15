runControlledForwardResponse.m
This is the main code that runs on our ardiuno. It receives desired position data from the pi and moves the motors to that position.

runForwardResponse.m
This is the simulink model for our motors that we used to create a position controller. We ran this and used the tune function of the PI controller to find our PI values.

# MatLab Position Response
This was everything used to model the position response and create the inner loop controller.
Controlled is everything for the inner loop.
The outer loop controller was created with the simulink at Demo1/Ardiuno/Matlab/Angular/ControlledAnglePositionResponse.slx
We used that and just changed the k, kp, and sigma values to the ones here
